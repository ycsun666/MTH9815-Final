# MTH9815-Final
Yicheng Sun's MTH9815 Final Project

## Overview

This project involves the development of a comprehensive bond trading system tailored for US Treasury securities. It covers a range of securities including 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, and 30Y Treasuries. The system is designed to handle various aspects of bond trading including trade booking, risk management, pricing, and market data services, etc.

## System Components

### Services

The bond trading system includes the following services, each addressing specific functionalities:

- **BondTradeBookingService**: Manages trade bookings for Treasury bonds.
- **BondPositionService**: Tracks and manages positions in Treasury bonds.
- **BondRiskService**: Assesses and manages risks associated with bond trading.
- **BondPricingService**: Provides pricing data for Treasury bonds.
- **BondMarketDataService**: Delivers market data related to Treasury bonds.
- **BondExecutionService**: Handles the execution of bond trades.
- **BondStreamingService**: Streams bond market data.
- **BondAlgoExecutionService**: Implements algorithmic trading strategies for bonds.
- **BondAlgoStreamingService**: Manages algorithmic processing of bond market data.
- **GUIService**: Provides a graphical user interface for the trading system.
- **BondInquiryService**: Manages inquiries and information requests about bond trades.
- **BondHistoricalDataService**: Stores and retrieves historical data for bonds.

### Connectors

Connectors are used to interface the services with external data sources and destinations.

### Data Flow

Data is read from files in a separate process and published via sockets into the trading system. This data flow involves the following steps:

1. **File Reading**: Data is read from files via a subclass of Connector.
2. **Publishing via Socket**: The read data is then published via a socket using another Connector.
3. **Inbound Processing**: An inbound Connector in the trading system reads data from the socket.
4. **Service Integration**: Data is flowed into the relevant service using `Service.OnMessage()` method.

### Dependencies

Services are connected via Connectors and Listeners. Data flows in the trading system includes:

#### Price Data

- pricing service -> algostreaming service -> streaming service -> historicaldata service
- pricing service -> GUI service -> GUI data output

#### Orderbook data

- marketdata service -> algoexecution service -> execution service -> historicaldata service

- execution service -> tradebooking service -> position service -> risk service -> historicaldata service

#### Trade data

- trade booking service -> position service -> risk service -> historical data service

#### Inquiry data

- inquiry service -> historical data service

## Sample Data Generation

For testing and demonstration purposes, sample data for each type of service should be created. This data includes trades, prices, marketdata, and inquiries. Data files are generated by functions in datagen.hpp and stored in .txt under data folder.

## Running and Compilation

The project uses C++17 standards and Boost 1.83.0 version. CMakeLists.txt file is under TradingSystem folder to generate Makefile. The executable file main is under build folder.
